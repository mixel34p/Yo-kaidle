## 👻 About the Game

Yo-kaidle brings the addictive mechanics of daily guessing games to the colorful world of Yo-kai Watch. Every day offers a new challenge to figure out which Yo-kai is hiding behind the mystery.

Whether you're a seasoned Yo-kai Watch veteran who knows every tribe matchup or just discovered these spirited creatures, there's fun to be had testing your knowledge against the Medallium.

## 🎮 Game Modes

### 📅 Daily Challenge
The classic mode. One Yo-kai, one attempt per day. Everyone in the world gets the same Yo-kai, so you can share your results and compete with friends to see who solved it in fewer tries.

### ♾️ Infinite Mode
Addicted to the loop? Infinite Mode helps you practice your knowledge without limits. Play as many games as you want and try to build the highest streak possible!
